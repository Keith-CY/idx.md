  # Flow chart syntax

  ## Nodes

  A node is the most basic building block in a flow chart.

  Node definitions consist of a name followed by an optional set of properties.
  For example, `Start` is the name of below node and it has an `shape` property
  which is set to `oval`.

  ```

  Start [shape: oval]

  ```

  Node names are required to be unique.

  Nodes support `shape`, `icon`, `color`, and `label` properties. More on
  properties below.
