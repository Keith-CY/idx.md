  # MCP Server Recommendations

  MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude's capabilities by
  connecting to external tools and services.

  **Note**: These are common MCP servers. Use web search to find MCP servers
  specific to the codebase's services and integrations.

  ## Setup & Team Sharing

  **Connection methods:**

  1. **Project config** (`.mcp.json`) - Available only in that directory

  2. **Global config** (`~/.claude.json`) - Available across all projects

  3. **Checked-in `.mcp.json`** - Available to entire team (recommended!)

  **Tip**: Check `.mcp.json` into git so your whole team gets the same MCP
  servers.

  **Debugging**: Use `claude --mcp-debug` to identify configuration issues.
