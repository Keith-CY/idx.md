  # Writing Skills

  ## Overview

  **Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process
  documentation.**

  **Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (`~/.claude/skills` for
  Claude Code, `~/.agents/skills/` for Codex)**

  You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail
  (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents
  comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

  **Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you
  don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.
