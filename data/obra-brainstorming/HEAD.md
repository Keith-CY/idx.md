  # Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

  ## Overview

  Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural
  collaborative dialogue.

  Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at
  a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present
  the design and get user approval.

  <HARD-GATE>

  Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project,
  or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the
  user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived
  simplicity.
