  # Audit Checklist

  Use this checklist when reviewing motion design in any UI code.

  ---

  ## Philosophy Check (Do First)

  - [ ] **How often will users trigger this?** (Frequent = less/no animation —
  Emil's rule)

  - [ ] **Is this keyboard-initiated?** (If yes, don't animate — Emil's rule)

  - [ ] **Does this animation serve a purpose?** (orientation, feedback,
  continuity—not just decoration)

  - [ ] **Will users notice this animation consciously?** (If yes for production
  UI, probably too much)

  - [ ] **Have I tested this with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`?**

  - [ ] **Does this feel natural after the 10th interaction?** (Test repeatedly,
  not just once)
