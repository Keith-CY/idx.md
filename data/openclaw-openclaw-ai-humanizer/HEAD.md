    text to make it sound more natural and human-written. Based on Wikipedia's
    comprehensive "Signs of AI writing" guide. Detects and fixes patterns including:
    inflated symbolism, promotional language, superficial -ing analyses, vague
    attributions, em dash overuse, rule of three, AI vocabulary words, negative
    parallelisms, and excessive conjunctive phrases.
