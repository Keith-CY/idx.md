idx.md

Open, agent-first knowledge index built entirely in plain Markdown.
Browse the index, then fetch HEAD/BODY per topic (with integrity hashes).

Purpose:
- Markdown registry for AI agent libraries and resources.
- Agents can browse to learn everything they could use, then fetch the exact markdown.

Key URLs:
- Skill / usage: https://idx.md/SKILL.md (aliases: https://idx.md/skill.md, https://idx.md/)
- All topics (canonical): https://idx.md/data/index.md (alias: https://idx.md/index.md)
- Capability navigation: https://idx.md/category/index.md
- Scenario navigation: https://idx.md/scenario/index.md
- Industry navigation: https://idx.md/industry/index.md
- Sitemap: https://idx.md/sitemap.xml

How to choose a navigation mode:
- If you know what you want: start from /data/index.md and search by keywords in titles/tags.
- If you want tools by capability: start from /category/index.md.
- If you have a specific workflow/use-case: start from /scenario/index.md.
- If you're operating in a specific domain: start from /industry/index.md.

Index entry format:
- Each entry is a YAML frontmatter block (between '---' lines) followed by a topic line:
  |/data/{topic}|
- The index may start with a short HTML comment preamble; entries begin at the first frontmatter block.

How to fetch a topic:
- HEAD metadata: https://idx.md/{topic} (alias of /data/{topic}/HEAD.md)
- BODY content: https://idx.md/{topic}/BODY.md
- Integrity: compute SHA-256 of the raw BODY bytes (no normalization) and compare to 'content_sha256' in HEAD frontmatter.
- Freshness: use HEAD 'retrieved_at' to decide whether a cached BODY needs refresh.

Integrity details:
- content_sha256 is the SHA-256 of the exact BODY bytes.
- Format: 64 lowercase hex characters.
- If the hash differs, re-download BODY.md.

Example flow:
- Read /data/index.md -> pick {topic} -> fetch /{topic} (HEAD) -> fetch /{topic}/BODY.md -> verify hash.

URL map:
- /, /skill.md, /SKILL.md -> usage document
- /index.md, /data/index.md -> index listing
- /category/index.md -> category index listing
- /category/{category}/index.md -> category topic listing
- /scenario/index.md -> scenario index listing
- /scenario/{scenario}/index.md -> scenario topic listing
- /industry/index.md -> industry index listing
- /industry/{industry}/index.md -> industry topic listing
- /{topic} -> /data/{topic}/HEAD.md
- /{topic}/HEAD.md -> HEAD metadata
- /{topic}/BODY.md -> BODY content

Constraints:
- Markdown-only outputs; '.mdx' is rejected by filename.
