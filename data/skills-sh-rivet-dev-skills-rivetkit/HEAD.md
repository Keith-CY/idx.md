  # Actions

  > Source: `src/content/docs/actors/actions.mdx`

  > Canonical URL: https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/actions

  > Description: Actions are how your backend, frontend, or other actors can
  communicate with actors. Actions are defined as functions in the actor
  configuration and can be called from clients.

  ---

  Actions are very lightweight. They can be called thousands of times per second
  safely.

  Actions are executed via HTTP requests or via WebSockets if [using
  `.connect()`](/docs/actors/connections).

  For advanced use cases that require direct access to HTTP requests or
  WebSocket connections, see [raw HTTP and WebSocket
  handling](/docs/actors/fetch-and-websocket-handler).
