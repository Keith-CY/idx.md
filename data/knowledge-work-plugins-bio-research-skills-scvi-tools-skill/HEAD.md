title: scvi-tools
summary: Deep learning for single-cell analysis using scvi-tools. This skill
  should be used when users need (1) data integration and batch correction with
  scVI/scANVI, (2) ATAC-seq analysis with PeakVI, (3) CITE-seq multi-modal
  analysis with totalVI, (4) multiome RNA+ATAC analysis with MultiVI, (5)
  spatial transcriptomics deconvolution with DestVI, (6) label transfer and
  reference mapping with scANVI/scArches, (7) RNA velocity with veloVI, or (8)
  any deep learning-based single-cell method. Triggers include mentions of scVI,
  scANVI, totalVI, PeakVI, MultiVI, DestVI, veloVI, sysVI, scArches, variational
  autoencoder, VAE, batch correction, data integration, multi-modal, CITE-seq,
  multiome, reference mapping, latent space.
