  platform.

  # Deploy to Render

  Render supports **Git-backed** services and **prebuilt Docker image**
  services.

  This skill covers **Git-backed** flows:

  1. **Blueprint Method** - Generate render.yaml for Infrastructure-as-Code
  deployments

  2. **Direct Creation** - Create services instantly via MCP tools

  Blueprints can also run a **prebuilt Docker image** by using `runtime: image`,
  but the `render.yaml` still must live in a Git repo.
