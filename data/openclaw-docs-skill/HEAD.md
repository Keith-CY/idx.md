  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables agents to operate as always-on personal AI assistants across
  multiple messaging platforms simultaneously. Agents can execute complex
  workflows including browser automation, shell command execution, file
  operations, media processing, and scheduled tasks. The system supports
  multi-agent routing with isolated workspaces, session management with memory
  persistence, and sandboxed execution environments for security. Agents can
  spawn sub-agents for parallel work, integrate with 15+ messaging channels, and
  leverage multiple AI model providers with automatic failover.
