  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables AI agents to operate across multiple messaging channels with
  sophisticated automation, tool integration, and multi-agent coordination.
  Agents can handle direct messages and group chats, execute shell commands,
  control browsers, manage scheduled tasks, and coordinate with other agents—all
  through a unified Gateway architecture.
