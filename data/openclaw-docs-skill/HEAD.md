  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables AI agents to interact across multiple messaging channels with
  powerful automation capabilities. Agents can browse the web, execute commands,
  manage files, schedule tasks, coordinate with other agents, and integrate with
  external services. The system supports both local and cloud deployments with
  optional Docker sandboxing for security isolation.
