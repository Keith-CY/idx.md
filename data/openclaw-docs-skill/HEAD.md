  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw empowers AI agents to operate across messaging platforms (WhatsApp,
  Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, MS Teams, and more) with a unified
  gateway. Agents can execute shell commands, automate browsers, manage files,
  coordinate with sub-agents, schedule tasks, and maintain persistent sessions
  with memory management. The platform provides multi-agent routing, sandboxed
  execution, and comprehensive security controls for safe, isolated agent
  operations.
