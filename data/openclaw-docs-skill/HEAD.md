  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant platform that enables agents to interact
  across multiple messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack,
  Signal, iMessage, MS Teams, Google Chat, Mattermost, and more) while providing
  powerful automation, tool execution, and multi-agent coordination. Agents can
  execute shell commands, automate workflows, browse the web, control browsers,
  manage sessions with persistent memory, and coordinate with other agents—all
  with configurable security sandboxing and access controls.
