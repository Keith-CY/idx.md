  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables agents to operate as personal AI assistants across multiple
  messaging platforms simultaneously. Agents can execute shell commands,
  automate browser interactions, manage files, schedule tasks, capture media,
  and coordinate with other agents—all while maintaining isolated sessions and
  persistent memory per user or group. The system provides a self-hosted control
  plane (Gateway) that routes messages from various channels to configured
  agents with full tool access and security controls.
