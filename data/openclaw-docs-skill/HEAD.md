  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables AI agents to operate autonomously across messaging platforms
  (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, Signal, and 10+ others) with
  full tool access, session management, and workflow automation. Agents can
  execute shell commands, control browsers, capture media from devices, search
  the web, manage long-term memory, and coordinate with other agents—all within
  configurable security boundaries.
