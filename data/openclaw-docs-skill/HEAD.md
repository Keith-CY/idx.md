  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables AI agents to operate across multiple messaging platforms
  simultaneously through a single self-hosted gateway. Agents can execute
  complex workflows including browser automation, file operations, shell
  commands, and inter-agent communication. The system supports persistent
  sessions with memory management, multi-agent routing with workspace isolation,
  and comprehensive security controls including sandboxing and elevated
  execution modes.
