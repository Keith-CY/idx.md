  ## Capabilities

  ClawdBot (OpenClaw) enables AI agents to operate autonomously across multiple
  channels and platforms with sophisticated task automation, browser control,
  and system integration. Agents can receive messages from 15+ messaging
  platforms, execute shell commands, control browsers, schedule tasks, manage
  sessions with persistent memory, and coordinate with other agents—all within a
  secure, sandboxed environment with granular permission controls.
