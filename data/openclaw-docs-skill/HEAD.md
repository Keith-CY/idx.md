  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables agents to operate as always-on personal AI assistants across
  multiple messaging platforms. Agents can execute complex workflows including
  browser automation, file operations, system commands, scheduled tasks, and
  multi-agent coordination. The system provides deterministic tool execution,
  session persistence, memory management, and security controls through
  sandboxing and tool policies.
