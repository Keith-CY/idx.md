  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw is a self-hosted gateway that bridges messaging applications to AI
  agents with full tool access, persistent sessions, and multi-agent routing.
  Agents can automate tasks across 15+ messaging channels, execute shell
  commands, control browsers, manage files, schedule jobs, and coordinate with
  other agents—all while maintaining isolated workspaces and session memory.
