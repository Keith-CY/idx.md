  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw enables AI agents to operate autonomously across messaging platforms,
  execute system commands, automate browser interactions, and coordinate complex
  multi-agent workflows. Agents can maintain persistent sessions with automatic
  memory management, access web content, control devices, schedule tasks, and
  operate in isolated sandboxed environments for security.
