  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw is a self-hosted gateway that enables AI agents to interact across
  multiple messaging platforms simultaneously. Agents can execute complex
  workflows including browser automation, file operations, shell commands, and
  multi-step automation. The system supports persistent sessions with memory
  management, multi-agent routing with isolated workspaces, and extensible tool
  ecosystems through skills and plugins.
