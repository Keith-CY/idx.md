  ## Capabilities

  OpenClaw is a comprehensive agent runtime platform that enables AI agents to
  operate across multiple messaging channels, execute complex workflows, and
  manage sophisticated multi-agent systems. Agents can send and receive messages
  on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, MS Teams, and many
  other platforms. They can automate tasks through browser control, shell
  command execution, scheduled jobs, and deterministic workflows. The platform
  supports advanced features like sandboxed execution, multi-agent routing with
  workspace isolation, session management with memory persistence, and
  integration with multiple LLM providers.
