  ## Capabilities

  Agent Skills enable AI agents to extend their capabilities with specialized
  knowledge and workflows. Agents can discover and load skills on demand to
  perform complex tasks more accurately and efficiently. Skills provide domain
  expertise, new capabilities (like creating presentations or analyzing
  datasets), repeatable workflows, and interoperability across different agent
  products. The progressive disclosure model keeps agents fast by loading only
  metadata at startup and full instructions when needed.
