  ## Capabilities

  Agent Skills enable AI agents to extend their capabilities with specialized
  knowledge and workflows. Agents can discover, load, and execute skills to
  perform domain-specific tasks more accurately and efficiently. Skills provide
  procedural knowledge, company-specific context, and reusable workflows that
  agents can activate on demand, allowing them to handle complex tasks across
  multiple domains without requiring constant retraining or context expansion.
