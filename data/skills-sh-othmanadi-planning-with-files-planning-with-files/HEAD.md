  <!--
    WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
    WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
    WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
  -->

  ## Goal

  <!--
    WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
    WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
