  # knitwork-x Overview

  knitwork-x provides **utilities to generate JavaScript and TypeScript code**
  as strings. It is forked from [knitwork](https://github.com/unjs/knitwork) and
  adds comprehensive TypeScript helpers: ESM, strings, variables, classes,
  interfaces, functions, types, control flow, and serialization.

  ## When to Use

  - **Code generators:** Build tools that emit JS/TS source (e.g.
  schema-to-types, API clients).

  - **Dynamic modules:** Generate import/export and function/class bodies at
  runtime.

  - **AST-to-code:** Turn structured data into code strings without a full AST
  library.
