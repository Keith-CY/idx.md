  # Writing Plans

  ## Overview

  Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero
  context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need
  to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might
  need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks.
  DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

  Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset
  or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

  **Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the
  implementation plan."

  **Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by
  brainstorming skill).
