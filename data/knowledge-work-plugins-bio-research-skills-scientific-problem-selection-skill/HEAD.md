title: scientific-problem-selection
summary: This skill should be used when scientists need help with research
  problem selection, project ideation, troubleshooting stuck projects, or
  strategic scientific decisions. Use this skill when users ask to pitch a new
  research idea, work through a project problem, evaluate project risks, plan
  research strategy, navigate decision trees, or get help choosing what
  scientific problem to work on. Typical requests include "I have an idea for a
  project", "I'm stuck on my research", "help me evaluate this project", "what
  should I work on", or "I need strategic advice about my research".
