  # Resend SDK Installation Guide

  Always install the latest SDK version to ensure you have support for all
  features including webhook verification (`webhooks.verify()`) and email
  receiving (`emails.receiving.get()`). Older versions may not include these
  methods.

  ## Minimum SDK Versions

  These are the minimum versions required for full functionality (sending,
  receiving, and webhook verification). Always prefer the latest version when
  possible.
