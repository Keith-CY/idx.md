  # LangChain Agents Guide

  Complete guide to building agents with ReAct, tool calling, and streaming.

  ## What are agents?

  Agents combine language models with tools to solve complex tasks through
  reasoning and action:

  1. **Reasoning**: LLM decides what to do

  2. **Acting**: Execute tools based on reasoning

  3. **Observation**: Receive tool results

  4. **Loop**: Repeat until task complete

  This is the **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning + Acting).
