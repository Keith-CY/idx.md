  # Skill Installer

  Helps install skills. By default these are from
  https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also
  provide other locations.

  Use the helper scripts based on the task:

  - List skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this
  skill without specifying what to do. Default listing is `.curated`, but you
  can pass `--path skills/.experimental` when they ask about experimental
  skills.
