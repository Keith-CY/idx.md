title: instrument-data-to-allotrope
summary: Convert laboratory instrument output files (PDF, CSV, Excel, TXT) to
  Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) JSON format or flattened 2D CSV. Use this skill
  when scientists need to standardize instrument data for LIMS systems, data
  lakes, or downstream analysis. Supports auto-detection of instrument types.
  Outputs include full ASM JSON, flattened CSV for easy import, and exportable
  Python code for data engineers. Common triggers include converting instrument
  files, standardizing lab data, preparing data for upload to LIMS/ELN systems,
  or generating parser code for production pipelines.
