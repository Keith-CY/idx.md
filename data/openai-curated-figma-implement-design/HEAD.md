  description: "Translate Figma nodes into production-ready code with 1:1 visual
  fidelity using the Figma MCP workflow (design context, screenshots, assets,
  and project-convention translation). Trigger when the user provides Figma URLs
  or node IDs, or asks to implement designs or components that must match Figma
  specs. Requires a working Figma MCP server connection."

  # Implement Design

  ## Overview

  This skill provides a structured workflow for translating Figma designs into
  production-ready code with pixel-perfect accuracy. It ensures consistent
  integration with the Figma MCP server, proper use of design tokens, and 1:1
  visual parity with designs.

  ## Prerequisites

  - Figma MCP server must be connected and accessible

  - User must provide a Figma URL in the format:
  `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`
