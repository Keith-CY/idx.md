  # arch-tsdown-monorepo Overview

  arch-tsdown-monorepo is a **pnpm monorepo** starter for TypeScript libraries,
  based on
  [hairyf/starter-monorepo](https://github.com/hairyf/starter-monorepo). Each
  package uses **tsdown** for building. Use this skill when scaffolding or
  maintaining a multi-package TypeScript/ESM library with shared tooling and
  workspace dependencies.

  ## What It Is

  - A **monorepo starter** for publishing multiple TypeScript packages from one
  repo

  - Build: **tsdown** per package (same pattern as arch-tsdown)

  - Workspace: **pnpm** with `packages/*`, **catalogs** for shared devDependency
  versions
