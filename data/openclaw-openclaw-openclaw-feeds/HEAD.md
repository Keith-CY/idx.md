  description: >
    RSS news aggregator. Fetches headlines from curated feeds across three categories: news, games,
    and finance. Use when the user asks about current news, headlines, what's happening, what's going
    on, or says "what's up in news", "what's up in finance", "what's up in games", or the German
    equivalents "was geht mit nachrichten", "was geht mit money", "was geht mit gaming". Also
    activates for requests like "give me a news rundown", "latest headlines", "market news",
    "gaming news", "tech news", "finance roundup", or "briefing". Returns structured JSON from
    public RSS feeds — no API keys, no web search needed.
