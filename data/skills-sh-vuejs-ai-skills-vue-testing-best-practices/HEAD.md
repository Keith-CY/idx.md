  # Use Vitest for Vue 3 Testing - Recommended by Vue Team

  **Impact: MEDIUM** - Vitest is created and maintained by Vue/Vite team members
  and shares the same configuration and transform pipeline as Vite. Using Jest
  or other test runners with Vite-based projects requires additional
  configuration and can result in slower test execution and compatibility
  issues.

  Use Vitest for new Vue 3 projects. Only consider Jest if migrating an existing
  test suite.
