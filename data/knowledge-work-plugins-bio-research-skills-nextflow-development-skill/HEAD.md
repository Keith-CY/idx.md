  sequencing data. Use when analyzing RNA-seq, WGS/WES, or ATAC-seq data—either
  local FASTQs or public datasets from GEO/SRA. Triggers on nf-core, Nextflow,
  FASTQ analysis, variant calling, gene expression, differential expression, GEO
  reanalysis, GSE/GSM/SRR accessions, or samplesheet creation.
