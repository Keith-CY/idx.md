  # Test-Driven Development (TDD)

  ## Overview

  Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

  **Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it
  tests the right thing.

  **Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**
