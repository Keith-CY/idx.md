  ## Em Dashes: The Primary AI Tell

  **The em dash (—) has become one of the most reliable markers of AI-generated
  content.**

  Em dashes are longer than hyphens (-) and are used for emphasis,
  interruptions, or parenthetical information. While they have legitimate uses
  in writing, AI models drastically overuse them.

  ### Why Em Dashes Signal AI Writing

  - AI models were trained on edited books, academic papers, and style guides
  where em dashes appear frequently

  - AI uses em dashes as a shortcut for sentence variety instead of commas,
  colons, or parentheses
