stable_id: skills/knowledge-work-plugins-bio-research-skills-instrument-data-to-allotrope-skill
type: skills
title: instrument-data-to-allotrope
summary: Convert laboratory instrument output files (PDF, CSV, Excel, TXT) to
  Allotrope Simple Model (ASM) JSON format or flattened 2D CSV. Use this skill
  when scientists need to standardize instrument data for LIMS systems, data
  lakes, or downstream analysis. Supports auto-detection of instrument types.
  Outputs include full ASM JSON, flattened CSV for easy import, and exportable
  Python code for data engineers. Common triggers include converting instrument
  files, standardizing lab data, preparing data for upload to LIMS/ELN systems,
  or generating parser code for production pipelines.

type: skills
title: scientific-problem-selection
summary: This skill should be used when scientists need help with research
  problem selection, project ideation, troubleshooting stuck projects, or
  strategic scientific decisions. Use this skill when users ask to pitch a new
  research idea, work through a project problem, evaluate project risks, plan
  research strategy, navigate decision trees, or get help choosing what
  scientific problem to work on. Typical requests include "I have an idea for a
  project", "I'm stuck on my research", "help me evaluate this project", "what
  should I work on", or "I need strategic advice about my research".
