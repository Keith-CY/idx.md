  # Data Scraping Guide

  For large datasets (followers, posts, search results), **intercept and replay
  network requests** rather than scrolling and parsing the DOM. This is faster,
  more reliable, and handles pagination automatically.

  ## Why Not Scroll?

  Scrolling is slow, unreliable, and wastes time. APIs return structured data
  with pagination built in. Always prefer API replay.

  ## Start Small, Then Scale

  **Don't try to automate everything at once.** Work incrementally:

  1. **Capture one request** - verify you're intercepting the right endpoint

  2. **Inspect one response** - understand the schema before writing extraction
  code

  3. **Extract a few items** - make sure your parsing logic works

  4. **Then scale up** - add pagination loop only after the basics work
