  <EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

  If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are
  doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

  IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

  This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way
  out of this.
