  ## Capabilities

  Agent Skills enable AI agents to extend their capabilities with specialized
  knowledge and workflows. Agents can discover, load, and execute skills to
  perform domain-specific tasks more accurately and efficiently. Skills provide
  procedural knowledge, company-specific context, and reusable workflows that
  agents can activate on demand, allowing them to handle complex tasks across
  multiple domains without requiring constant retraining or context expansion.

  GitHub Markup

  =============

  This library is the **first step** of a journey that every markup file in a
  repository goes on before it is rendered on GitHub.com:

  1. `github-markup` selects an _underlying library_ to convert the raw markup
  to HTML. See the list of [supported markup formats](#markups) below.

  1. The HTML is sanitized, aggressively removing things that could harm you and
  your kin—such as `script` tags, inline-styles, and `class` or `id` attributes.

  1. Syntax highlighting is performed on code blocks. See
  [github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist#syntax-highlighting) for
  more information about syntax highlighting.

  1. The HTML is passed through other filters that add special sauce, such as
  emoji, task lists, named anchors, CDN caching for images, and autolinking.

  1. The resulting HTML is rendered on GitHub.com.

  Please note that **only the first step** is covered by this gem — the rest
  happens on GitHub.com.  In particular, `markup` itself does no sanitization of
  the resulting HTML, as it expects that to be covered by whatever pipeline is
  consuming the HTML.

  Please see our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before reporting an
  issue.

  # Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

  ## Overview

  Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural
  collaborative dialogue.

  Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at
  a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present
  the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section
  whether it looks right so far.

  ## The Process

  # Dispatching Parallel Agents

  ## Overview

  When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different
  subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each
  investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.

  **Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let
  them work concurrently.

  ## Overview

  Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying

  # Writing Plans

  ## Overview

  Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero
  context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need
  to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might
  need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks.
  DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

  Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset
  or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

  **Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the
  implementation plan."

  **Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by
  brainstorming skill).

  # Writing Skills

  ## Overview

  **Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process
  documentation.**

  **Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (`~/.claude/skills` for
  Claude Code, `~/.codex/skills` for Codex)**

  You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail
  (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents
  comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

  **Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you
  don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

  Prereq: ensure `gh` is authenticated (for example, run `gh auth login` once),
  then run `gh auth status` with escalated permissions (include workflow/repo
  scopes) so `gh` commands succeed. If sandboxing blocks `gh auth status`, rerun

  # Gh Pr Checks Plan Fix

  ## Overview

  Use gh to locate failing PR checks, fetch GitHub Actions logs for actionable
  failures, summarize the failure snippet, then propose a fix plan and implement
  after explicit approval.

  - If a plan-oriented skill (for example `create-plan`) is available, use it;
  otherwise draft a concise plan inline and request approval before
  implementing.

  Prereq: authenticate with the standard GitHub CLI once (for example, run `gh
  auth login`), then confirm with `gh auth status` (repo + workflow scopes are
  typically required).

  Treat this skill as CLI-first automation. Do not pivot to `@playwright/test`
  unless the user explicitly asks for test files.

  ## Prerequisite check (required)

  Before proposing commands, check whether `npx` is available (the wrapper
  depends on it):

  # Deploy to Render

  Render supports **Git-backed** services and **prebuilt Docker image**
  services.

  This skill covers **Git-backed** flows:

  1. **Blueprint Method** - Generate render.yaml for Infrastructure-as-Code
  deployments

  2. **Direct Creation** - Create services instantly via MCP tools

  Blueprints can also run a **prebuilt Docker image** by using `runtime: image`,
  but the `render.yaml` still must live in a Git repo.

  # Security Best Practices

  ## Overview

  This skill provides a description of how to identify the language and
  frameworks used by the current context, and then to load information from this
  skill's references directory about the security best practices for this
  language and or frameworks.

  This information, if present, can be used to write new secure by default code,
  or to passively detect major issues within existing code, or (if requested by
  the user) provide a vulnerability report and suggest fixes.

  ## Workflow

  The initial step for this skill is to identify ALL languages and ALL
  frameworks which you are being asked to use or already exist in the scope of
  the project you are working in. Focus on the primary core frameworks. Often
  you will want to identify both frontend and backend languages and frameworks.

  1) Collect (or infer) inputs:

  - Repo root path and any in-scope paths.

  - Intended usage, deployment model, internet exposure, and auth expectations
  (if known).

  # Skill Installer

  Helps install skills. By default these are from
  https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also
  provide other locations. Experimental skills live in
  https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.experimental and can be
  installed the same way.

  Use the helper scripts based on the task:

  - List skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this
  skill without specifying what to do. Default listing is `.curated`, but you
  can pass `--path skills/.experimental` when they ask about experimental
  skills.

  ## Capabilities

  ClawdBot (OpenClaw) enables AI agents to operate autonomously across multiple
  channels and platforms with sophisticated task automation, browser control,
  and system integration. Agents can receive messages from 15+ messaging
  platforms, execute shell commands, control browsers, schedule tasks, manage
  sessions with persistent memory, and coordinate with other agents—all within a
  secure, sandboxed environment with granular permission controls.

    MANDATORY agent discovery system for token-efficient agent loading. Claude MUST use this skill
    instead of loading agents directly from ~/.claude/agents/ or .claude/agents/. Provides lazy
    loading via search_agents and get_agent tools. Use when: (1) user task may benefit from
    specialized agent expertise, (2) user asks about available agents, (3) starting complex
    workflows that historically used agents. This skill reduces context window usage by ~95%
    compared to loading all agents upfront.

    RSS news aggregator. Fetches headlines from curated feeds across three categories: news, games,
    and finance. Use when the user asks about current news, headlines, what's happening, what's going
    on, or says "what's up in news", "what's up in finance", "what's up in games", or the German
    equivalents "was geht mit nachrichten", "was geht mit money", "was geht mit gaming". Also
    activates for requests like "give me a news rundown", "latest headlines", "market news",
    "gaming news", "tech news", "finance roundup", or "briefing". Returns structured JSON from
    public RSS feeds — no API keys, no web search needed.

    (3) Need formatting unavailable via Clawdbot's Markdown conversion (underline, spoilers, expandable blockquotes, user mentions by ID),
    (4) Sending alerts, reports, summaries, or notifications to Telegram,
    (5) Want professional, scannable message formatting with visual hierarchy.
    Default to this skill for substantive Telegram communication.

  # Narrative Patterns for Math Explainers
  Common structures used in effective 3Blue1Brown-style videos.
  ## Pattern 1: Mystery → Investigation → Resolution
  **Structure:**
  1. Present a puzzling result or paradox
  2. Investigate why it's true through visual exploration
  3. Reveal the underlying principle
  4. Show how the principle generalizes
  **Example topics:** Euler's identity, Bayes theorem, infinite series paradoxes
  **Opening hooks:**

  A Scene is the canvas where all animations take place. Every Manim animation
  is defined within a Scene class.

  ## Basic Scene Structure

  All animation code resides within the `construct()` method of a Scene
  subclass.

  # MCP Server Recommendations

  MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude's capabilities by
  connecting to external tools and services.

  **Note**: These are common MCP servers. Use web search to find MCP servers
  specific to the codebase's services and integrations.

  ## Setup & Team Sharing

  **Connection methods:**

  1. **Project config** (`.mcp.json`) - Available only in that directory

  2. **Global config** (`~/.claude.json`) - Available across all projects

  3. **Checked-in `.mcp.json`** - Available to entire team (recommended!)

  **Tip**: Check `.mcp.json` into git so your whole team gets the same MCP
  servers.

  **Debugging**: Use `claude --mcp-debug` to identify configuration issues.

  # MCP Server Best Practices
  ## Quick Reference
  ### Server Naming
  - **Python**: `{service}_mcp` (e.g., `slack_mcp`)
  - **Node/TypeScript**: `{service}-mcp-server` (e.g., `slack-mcp-server`)
  ### Tool Naming
  - Use snake_case with service prefix
  - Format: `{service}_{action}_{resource}`
  - Example: `slack_send_message`, `github_create_issue`
  ### Response Formats

  # Editing Presentations

  ## Template-Based Workflow

  When using an existing presentation as a template:

  1. **Analyze existing slides**:
     ```bash
     python scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx
     python -m markitdown template.pptx
     ```
     Review `thumbnails.jpg` to see layouts, and markitdown output to see placeholder text.
  2. **Plan slide mapping**: For each content section, choose a template slide.

  # Apollo Client Integration for Client-Side Apps

  This guide covers setting up Apollo Client in client-side React applications
  without server-side rendering (SSR). This includes applications using Vite,
  Parcel, Create React App, or other bundlers that don't implement SSR.

  For applications with SSR, use one of the framework-specific integration
  guides instead:

  - [Next.js App Router](integration-nextjs.md)

  - [React Router Framework Mode](integration-react-router.md)

  - [TanStack Start](integration-tanstack-start.md)

  ## Installation

  ```bash

  npm install @apollo/client graphql rxjs

  # Chapter 1 - Coding Styles and Idioms

  ## 1.1 Borrowing Over Cloning

  Rust's ownership system encourages **borrow** (`&T`) instead of **cloning**
  (`T.clone()`).

  > ❗ Performance recommendation

  ### ✅ When to `Clone`:

  * You need to change the object AND preserve the original object (immutable
  snapshots).

  * When you have `Arc` or `Rc` pointers.

  * When data is shared across threads, usually `Arc`.

  * Avoid massive refactoring of non performance critical code.

  * When caching results (dummy example below):

  # assistant-ui Architecture

  ## Layered System

  assistant-ui follows a 4-layer architecture where each layer depends only on
  layers below it.

  ### Layer 1: RuntimeCore (Internal)

  Internal implementations that manage state:

  - `LocalRuntimeCore` - In-browser state

  - `ExternalStoreRuntimeCore` - External state sync

  - `ThreadListRuntimeCore` - Thread management

  # Securing MCP Servers

  MCP servers require authentication to ensure only trusted users can access
  them. The MCP specification uses OAuth 2.1 for authentication between clients
  and servers.

  Cloudflare's `workers-oauth-provider` handles token management, client
  registration, and access token validation automatically.

  ## Basic Setup

  ```typescript

  import { OAuthProvider } from "@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider";

  import { createMcpHandler } from "agents/mcp";

  const apiHandler = {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: unknown, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
      return createMcpHandler(server)(request, env, ctx);

  Reference for calculating sample sizes and test duration.

  ## Sample Size Fundamentals

  ### Required Inputs

  1. **Baseline conversion rate**: Your current rate

  2. **Minimum detectable effect (MDE)**: Smallest change worth detecting

  3. **Statistical significance level**: Usually 95% (α = 0.05)

  4. **Statistical power**: Usually 80% (β = 0.20)

  ### What These Mean

  **Baseline conversion rate**: If your page converts at 5%, that's your

  # AI Writing Detection

  Words, phrases, and punctuation patterns commonly associated with AI-generated
  text. Avoid these to ensure writing sounds natural and human.

  ## Em Dashes: The Primary AI Tell

  **The em dash (—) has become one of the most reliable markers of AI-generated
  content.**

  Em dashes are longer than hyphens (-) and are used for emphasis,
  interruptions, or parenthetical information. While they have legitimate uses
  in writing, AI models drastically overuse them.

  ### Why Em Dashes Signal AI Writing

  - AI models were trained on edited books, academic papers, and style guides
  where em dashes appear frequently

  - AI uses em dashes as a shortcut for sentence variety instead of commas,
  colons, or parentheses

  # Data Access Patterns - JavaScript Code Node

  Comprehensive guide to accessing data in n8n Code nodes using JavaScript.

  ---

  ## Overview

  In n8n Code nodes, you access data from previous nodes using built-in
  variables and methods. Understanding which method to use is critical for
  correct workflow execution.

  **Data Access Priority** (by common usage):

  1. **`$input.all()`** - Most common - Batch operations, aggregations

  2. **`$input.first()`** - Very common - Single item operations

  3. **`$input.item`** - Common - Each Item mode only

  4. **`$node["NodeName"].json`** - Specific node references

  # 어조 및 격식 일관성
  이 문서는 한국어 문서에서 어조와 격식 수준의 일관성을 유지하기 위한 패턴과 기준을 설명합니다.
  ## 패턴 1: 경어체 혼용
  **메타데이터**:
  - 출처: 국립국어원 공문서 작성 지침, 대학 논문 작성 지침
  - 권위: 🏛️ 법적 표준 + 📚 학술 표준
  - 버전: 1.0.0
  ### 설명
  한국어는 격식 수준에 따라 다양한 종결어미를 가지고 있습니다. 동일 문서 내에서 종결어미가 혼용되면 독자에게 일관성 없는 인상을 줍니다.
  ### 주요 경어체 분류

  # CrewAI Flows Guide

  ## Overview

  Flows provide event-driven orchestration with precise control over execution
  paths, state management, and conditional branching. Use Flows when you need
  more control than Crews provide.

  ## When to Use Flows vs Crews

  | Scenario | Use Crews | Use Flows |

  |----------|-----------|-----------|

  | Simple multi-agent collaboration | ✅ | |

  | Sequential/hierarchical tasks | ✅ | |

  | Conditional branching | | ✅ |

  | Complex state management | | ✅ |

  # LangChain Agents Guide

  Complete guide to building agents with ReAct, tool calling, and streaming.

  ## What are agents?

  Agents combine language models with tools to solve complex tasks through
  reasoning and action:

  1. **Reasoning**: LLM decides what to do

  2. **Acting**: Execute tools based on reasoning

  3. **Observation**: Receive tool results

  4. **Loop**: Repeat until task complete

  This is the **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning + Acting).

  # Always Use .value When Accessing ref() in JavaScript

  **Impact: HIGH** - Forgetting `.value` causes silent failures where state
  updates don't trigger reactivity, leading to hard-to-debug issues.

  When using `ref()` in Vue 3's Composition API, the reactive value is wrapped
  in an object and must be accessed via `.value` in JavaScript code. However, in
  templates, Vue automatically unwraps refs so `.value` is not needed there.
  This inconsistency is a common source of bugs.

  # Reanimated and SDK 54
  With the release of SDK 54, the recommended version of `react-native-reanimated` has moved to `4.x`. For many apps, upgrading will involve some manual steps, like installing the `react-native-worklets` package.
  You'll find all the necessary steps in the official migration guide provided by the Reanimated team [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/guides/migration-from-3.x/).
  A key point to note: if you're using `babel-preset-expo`, it automatically manages the reanimated Babel plugin for you.
  This means there's no need to change it to `react-native-worklets/plugin`, unless you manually specified a plugin in your project configuration.
  # Using SDK 54 with legacy architecture
  Although SDK 54 supports the legacy architecture, keep in mind that `react-native-reanimated` v4 is designed exclusively for the new architecture. We highly recommend making the switch to the new architecture when you can.
  If that's not feasible, you can still use SDK 54 with the legacy architecture, but you will need to downgrade `react-native-reanimated` to version v3.
  Since our tooling enforces the default version of packages, you will need to exclude `react-native-reanimated` from being checked by adding those lines to `package.json`:

  ## Slicing the store into smaller stores

  Your store can become bigger and bigger and tougher to maintain as you add
  more features.

  You can divide your main store into smaller individual stores to achieve
  modularity. This is simple to accomplish in Zustand!

  The first individual store:

  ```js

  export const createFishSlice = (set) => ({

  # Audit Checklist

  Use this checklist when reviewing motion design in any UI code.

  ---

  ## Philosophy Check (Do First)

  - [ ] **How often will users trigger this?** (Frequent = less/no animation —
  Emil's rule)

  - [ ] **Is this keyboard-initiated?** (If yes, don't animate — Emil's rule)

  - [ ] **Does this animation serve a purpose?** (orientation, feedback,
  continuity—not just decoration)

  - [ ] **Will users notice this animation consciously?** (If yes for production
  UI, probably too much)

  - [ ] **Have I tested this with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`?**

  - [ ] **Does this feel natural after the 10th interaction?** (Test repeatedly,
  not just once)

  # Rule Catalog — Code Quality

  ## Conditional class names use utility function

  IsUrgent: True

  Category: Code Quality

  ### Description

  Ensure conditional CSS is handled via the shared `classNames` instead of
  custom ternaries, string concatenation, or template strings. Centralizing
  class logic keeps components consistent and easier to maintain.

  ### Suggested Fix

  ```ts

  import { cn } from '@/utils/classnames'

  const classNames = cn(isActive ? 'text-primary-600' : 'text-gray-500')

  # Wrangler Configuration for NuxtHub v0.10.6

  **Default (Recommended):** NuxtHub auto-generates `wrangler.json` from your
  `hub` config in `nuxt.config.ts`. No manual wrangler.jsonc required.

  **Note:** Node.js compatibility (`nodejs_compat`) is automatically enabled for
  Cloudflare Workers in v0.10.5+.

  **Manual wrangler.jsonc:** Use when you need features not auto-generated
  (observability, migrations config, etc.) or prefer explicit file-based
  configuration.

  ## Minimal (Database Only)

  ```jsonc

  {
    "$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "name": "my-app",
    "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],

  > Canonical URL: https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/actions

  > Description: Actions are how your backend, frontend, or other actors can
  communicate with actors. Actions are defined as functions in the actor
  configuration and can be called from clients.

  ---

  Actions are very lightweight. They can be called thousands of times per second
  safely.

  Actions are executed via HTTP requests or via WebSockets if [using
  `.connect()`](/docs/actors/connections).

  For advanced use cases that require direct access to HTTP requests or
  WebSocket connections, see [raw HTTP and WebSocket
  handling](/docs/actors/fetch-and-websocket-handler).

  ## Writing Actions

  Actions are defined in the `actions` object when creating an actor:

  # Data Scraping Guide

  For large datasets (followers, posts, search results), **intercept and replay
  network requests** rather than scrolling and parsing the DOM. This is faster,
  more reliable, and handles pagination automatically.

  ## Why Not Scroll?

  Scrolling is slow, unreliable, and wastes time. APIs return structured data
  with pagination built in. Always prefer API replay.

  ## Start Small, Then Scale

  **Don't try to automate everything at once.** Work incrementally:

  1. **Capture one request** - verify you're intercepting the right endpoint

  2. **Inspect one response** - understand the schema before writing extraction
  code

  3. **Extract a few items** - make sure your parsing logic works

  4. **Then scale up** - add pagination loop only after the basics work

  # Common C4 Model Mistakes to Avoid

  This guide documents frequent anti-patterns and errors when creating C4
  architecture diagrams, with examples of what to do instead.

  ## Abstraction Level Mistakes

  ### 1. Confusing Containers and Components

  **The Problem:**

  Containers are **deployable units** (applications, services, databases).
  Components are **non-deployable elements inside a container** (modules,
  classes, packages).

  **Wrong - Java class shown as container:**

  # Difficult Conversation Framework

  Complete guide to the three-phase framework for challenging workplace
  conversations.

  ## The Three Phases in Depth

  ### Phase 1: Preparation (40% of Success)

  Most difficult conversations fail before they start. Thorough preparation
  dramatically improves outcomes.

  #### Step 1: Clarify the Facts

  ##### What happened? (Objective)

  Write down only observable facts:

  - What did you see or hear?

  - When and where did it happen?

  ## ref as Prop (No More forwardRef)

  React 19 allows ref as regular prop — forwardRef deprecated but still works.

  ```typescript

  # LLM Format Output Reference

  ## Overview

  The `--format llm` output is a compact, token-optimized hybrid XML/text format
  designed specifically for AI agent consumption. It provides structured audit
  data in a format that balances machine readability with token efficiency.

  ## Key Characteristics

  - **40-70% smaller** than verbose XML format

  - **1-space indentation** for minimal token usage

  - **Hybrid structure**: XML tags + text prefixes for metadata

  - **Inline attributes**: Metadata stored as XML attributes, not nested
  elements

  - **Comma-separated lists**: Pages and arrays formatted inline

  - **Flattened hierarchy**: Reduced nesting depth compared to verbose XML

  # What makes a good fuzz target

  This document explains the concept of a *fuzz target* and

  gives advice on how to make your fuzz targets really good.

  # Basics

  A *fuzz target* is a function that accepts an array of bytes and does
  something interesting with these bytes using the API under test.

  We define a specific signature for fuzz targets:

  ```cpp

  // fuzz_target.cc

  extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {
    DoSomethingInterestingWithMyAPI(Data, Size);

  # Using Instrumentation with Atheris and Native Extensions

  In order for native fuzzing to be effective, your native extensions must be
  built with Clang, using the argument `-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link` (and
  optionally other sanitizers).

  ## Step 1: Compiling your Extension

  While this doesn't work for every extension and build system, if you are using

  setuptools, you can typically compile a sanitized extension like this:

  ```

  CC="/usr/bin/clang" CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,fuzzer-no-link"
  CXX="/usr/bin/clang++" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address,fuzzer-no-link"
  LDSHARED="/usr/bin/clang -shared" pip3 install .

  ```

  Here, `address` means Address Sanitizer. You can also use `undefined` for the

  Undefined Behavior Sanitizer.

  # prek: Fast Pre-commit Hooks

  [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) is a fast, Rust-native drop-in
  replacement for pre-commit. It uses the same `.pre-commit-config.yaml` format
  and is fully compatible with existing configurations.

  ## Why prek over pre-commit?

  | Feature | prek | pre-commit |

  |---------|------|------------|

  | Speed | ~7x faster hook installation | Slower |

  | Dependencies | Single binary, no runtime needed | Requires Python |

  | Disk usage | Shared toolchains between hooks | Isolated environments |

  | Parallelism | Parallel repo cloning and hook execution | Sequential |

  | Python management | Uses uv automatically | Manual Python setup |

  Introspector report: [link](https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-introspector/xpdf/inspector-report/20220321/fuzz_report.html)
  A [previous blog post by Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html)
  details a vulnerability exploited by NSO to hack iOS users in xpdf. This vulnerability is in the `JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg`
  function in xpdf.
  xpdf is integrated into OSS-Fuzz, but the existing fuzzing did not cover [`JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg`](https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-coverage/xpdf/reports/20220331/linux/src/xpdf-4.03/xpdf/JBIG2Stream.cc.html#L1953).
  As shown in Figure 1, in the "Optimal target analysis" section of Fuzz Introspector report for xpdf, the
  second function suggested is `JBIG2Stream::reset()`.
  The main function called by `JBIG2Stream::reset()` is `JBIG2Stream::readSegments`.
  `readSegments` actually calls the vulnerable function `readTextRegionSeg`.

  # The Philosophy of Generic but Precise Variant Analysis

  This document covers the strategic thinking behind effective variant analysis.

  ## Why Variants Exist

  Vulnerabilities cluster because developers make consistent mistakes:

  1. **Developer habits**: Same person writes similar code, makes similar errors

  2. **Copy-paste propagation**: Boilerplate spreads bugs across the codebase

  3. **API misuse patterns**: Complex APIs invite consistent misunderstandings

  4. **Framework idioms**: Framework patterns create predictable vulnerability
  shapes

  5. **Incomplete fixes**: Original bug fixed in one place, missed elsewhere

  Understanding WHY variants exist helps predict WHERE to find them.

  # Use Debug Hooks to Trace Reactivity Issues

  **Impact: MEDIUM** - Vue provides debug hooks (`onTrack`, `onTrigger`,
  `renderTracked`, `renderTriggered`) that help identify exactly which reactive
  dependencies are being tracked and which mutations trigger re-execution. These
  are invaluable for debugging performance issues and unexpected re-renders.

  Debug hooks only work in development mode and are stripped in production
  builds. Use them to understand why a computed property, watcher, or component
  is re-executing.

  # Vue JSX Uses HTML Attributes Not React Conventions

  **Impact: MEDIUM** - Vue's JSX transform uses standard HTML attribute names
  (`class`, `for`) instead of React's JavaScript-friendly names (`className`,
  `htmlFor`). With proper TypeScript configuration, using React conventions like
  `className` or `htmlFor` will produce TypeScript errors, which is good for
  catching these inconsistencies early. Note that Vue's runtime is lenient and
  will actually convert these attributes correctly, but using HTML attributes is
  the recommended practice for consistency with Vue templates and proper type
  safety.

  When writing JSX in Vue, use the same attribute names you would use in regular
  HTML templates. This is a fundamental difference from React's JSX where
  `class` and `for` are reserved JavaScript keywords.

  # Always Use defineComponent for TypeScript Type Inference

  **Impact: HIGH** - When using TypeScript with Vue's Options API, you MUST wrap
  your component definition with `defineComponent()` to enable proper type
  inference. Without it, `this` is typed as `any`, losing all TypeScript
  benefits.

  title: Fix "No Active Pinia" Error - Store Setup Timing

  impact: HIGH

  impactDescription: Using Pinia stores before app.use(pinia) causes
  "getActivePinia was called but there was no active Pinia" error

  type: gotcha

  # Fix "No Active Pinia" Error - Store Setup Timing

  **Impact: HIGH** - The error "getActivePinia() was called but there was no
  active Pinia" is one of the most common Pinia errors. It occurs when you try
  to use a store before Pinia has been installed on the Vue app, causing your
  application to crash.

  title: Per-Route beforeEnter Guards Ignore Param/Query Changes

  impact: MEDIUM

  impactDescription: Route-level beforeEnter guards don't fire when only params,
  query, or hash change, causing unexpected bypasses of validation logic

  type: gotcha

  tags: [vue3, vue-router, navigation-guards, params, query]

  ---

  # Per-Route beforeEnter Guards Ignore Param/Query Changes

  **Impact: MEDIUM** - The `beforeEnter` guard defined in route configuration
  only triggers when entering a route from a DIFFERENT route. Changes to params,
  query strings, or hash within the same route do NOT trigger `beforeEnter`,
  potentially bypassing important validation logic.

  title: Use Vitest for Vue 3 Testing - Recommended by Vue Team

  impact: MEDIUM

  impactDescription: Using Jest or other runners with Vite projects requires
  complex configuration and causes slower test runs

  type: best-practice

  tags: [vue3, testing, vitest, vite, configuration, setup]

  ---

  # Use Vitest for Vue 3 Testing - Recommended by Vue Team

  **Impact: MEDIUM** - Vitest is created and maintained by Vue/Vite team members
  and shares the same configuration and transform pipeline as Vite. Using Jest
  or other test runners with Vite-based projects requires additional
  configuration and can result in slower test execution and compatibility
  issues.

  Use Vitest for new Vue 3 projects. Only consider Jest if migrating an existing
  test suite.

  description: Use when you need to act as an Elite Software Architect (Maestro)
  to manage complex repositories. It enforces a "Why over How" philosophy,
  maintains a persistent project memory (Brain), and orchestrates specialized
  sub-skills through a Plan-Act-Verify lifecycle.

  ---

  # MAESTRO: THE ARCHITECTURAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

  Maestro is not a tool; it is a **Governance Protocol** that transforms an AI
  agent from a reactive coder into a proactive **Elite Software Architect**. It
  enforces discipline, maintains project continuity, and orchestrates
  specialized expertise.

  ## � The Prime Directives (Mandatory)

  1.  **Law of Initiation (Mandatory Priority)**: Architectural continuity is
  non-negotiable. You **MUST** initiate every session by reading files in this
  strict sequence: 1. `SKILL.md` (Governance), 2. `agents/` (Persona), 3.
  `skills/` (Domain Expertise).

  2.  **Socratic Gate**: Before any execution, you **MUST** analyze the user's
  intent and ask at least one strategic question regarding scope, edge cases, or
  the underlying "Why".

  3.  **Architecture First**: Complex tasks require an `implementation_plan.md`
  (RFC-Lite). Do not write production code on assumptions.

  # Expo Mobile Application Development Guide

  > **IMPORTANT**: This is a SKILL file, NOT a project. NEVER run npm/bun
  install in this folder. NEVER create code files here. When creating a new
  project, ALWAYS ask the user for the project path first or create it in a
  separate directory (e.g., `~/Projects/app-name`).

  This guide is created to provide context when working with Expo projects using
  Claude Code.

  ## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

  When creating a new Expo project, you MUST include ALL of the following:

  ### Required Screens (ALWAYS CREATE)
