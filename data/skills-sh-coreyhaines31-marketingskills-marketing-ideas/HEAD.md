  rank quickly. Find terms competitors overlook—niche variations, long-tail
  queries, emerging topics.

  2. **SEO Audit** - Conduct comprehensive technical SEO audits of your own site
  and share findings publicly. Document fixes and improvements to build
  authority.

  3. **Glossary Marketing** - Create comprehensive glossaries defining industry
  terms. Each term becomes an SEO-optimized page targeting "what is X" searches.

  keyword patterns. Location pages, comparison pages, integration pages—any
  pattern with search volume.

  formats. Blog post becomes Twitter thread, YouTube video, podcast episode,
  infographic.

  create original research and reports. Data competitors can't replicate creates
  linkable assets.
