  # Using Git Worktrees

  ## Overview

  Git worktrees create isolated workspaces sharing the same repository, allowing

  **Core principle:** Systematic directory selection + safety verification =
  reliable isolation.

  **Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an
  isolated workspace."
