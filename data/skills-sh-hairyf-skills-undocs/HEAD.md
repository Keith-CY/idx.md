  # Getting Started with Undocs

  Undocs is a minimal Documentation Theme and CLI for shared usage across UnJS
  projects. It's built with Nuxt, Nuxt Content, and Nuxt UI with zero config and
  an elegant CLI wrapper.

  ## Quick Start

  Create a new documentation project using the template:

  ```bash

  npx giget gh:unjs/undocs/template docs --install
