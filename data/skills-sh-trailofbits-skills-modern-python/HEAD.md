  # prek: Fast Pre-commit Hooks

  [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) is a fast, Rust-native drop-in
  replacement for pre-commit. It uses the same `.pre-commit-config.yaml` format
  and is fully compatible with existing configurations.

  ## Why prek over pre-commit?

  | Feature | prek | pre-commit |

  |---------|------|------------|

  | Speed | ~7x faster hook installation | Slower |

  | Dependencies | Single binary, no runtime needed | Requires Python |

  | Disk usage | Shared toolchains between hooks | Isolated environments |

  | Parallelism | Parallel repo cloning and hook execution | Sequential |

  | Python management | Uses uv automatically | Manual Python setup |
