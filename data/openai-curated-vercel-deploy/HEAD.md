  # Vercel Deploy

  Deploy any project to Vercel instantly. No authentication required.

  ## Prerequisites

  - When sandboxing blocks the deployment network calls, rerun with
  `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.

  - The deployment might take a few minutes. Use appropriate timeout values.

  ## How It Works
