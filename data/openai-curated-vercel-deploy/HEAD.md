  # Vercel Deploy

  Deploy any project to Vercel instantly. **Always deploy as preview** (not
  production) unless the user explicitly asks for production.

  ## Prerequisites

  - When sandboxing blocks the deployment network calls, rerun with
  `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.

  - The deployment might take a few minutes. Use appropriate timeout values.
